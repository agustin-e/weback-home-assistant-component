# WeBack Robot Vacuum integration for Home Assistant
Custom component to control/automate Weback robot vacuum cleaners.

It has been tested only with the ABIR XS-X6 robot. But should work with many (most) weback controlled robot vaccuum cleaners. Please, let me know if your device is supported. This Home Assistant custom component was quite hard to create because of the complex reverse engineering process that took me several weeks of work. Hope you enjoy it.
